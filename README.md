# Automated Amplicon-based NGS Pipeline for Clinical Specimens

## About
This repository hosts the source code and associated data for the publication “Development of an automated amplicon-based next-generation sequencing pipeline for rapid detection of bacteria and fungi directly from clinical specimens”. It provides scripts, raw data, and expected outputs for the post-processing of abundance tables generated by the QIAGEN CLC Microbial Genomics Module.

## Features
- **Script Functionality**: The Jupyter notebooks provided in this repository perform sorting, normalization, and correction of abundance values for each sample and species based on control samples.
- **Filtering Levels**: The scripts implement three levels of filtering - 'Strict', 'Moderate', and 'Loose'.
- **Data Combination**: The `combine_filtered_tables` notebook combines all tables, reshapes them while preserving the original data.

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation
Install Pandas with pip:
```
pip install pandas
```
Or with Conda:
```
conda install pandas
```

Install JupyterLab:
```
pip install jupyterlab
```

Or install the classic Jupyter Notebook:
```
pip install notebook
```

### Running the Notebooks
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository and run each Jupyter notebook. 
4. Please execute `combine_filtered_tables` as the final step.

### Final Output
The final table contains corrected and filtered abundances for all samples, suitable for manual review and visualization.

## Repository Structure
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Located in the `jupyter_notebook` directory.
- **Data**: Input and output data are stored in `data` and `output_tables` directories, respectively.
- **Reference Libraries**: Includes PanBac, SSU, LSU, and UNITE libraries.
- **Output Variants**: Each script generates three different output CSV files using one reference library and three rule sets (e.g., `PanBac_strict.csv`, `SSU_moderate.csv`).
